All the code runs and looks good. I would say that you have to balance precision with time - if you look at challenge 2.3, you have set a very small time step. While this may improvement precision, you have to balance it with the consideration that such a small step will increase the process time (it is worth it?). Also, I think you misunderstood 2.3, you were to compare the final velocity of a fall with a constant gravity force against that of a variable one.
